# Data Ingestion and Display PoC

## Task
An example file of person data can be found in the `data` directory. The task is to 
create a Proof of Concept web application according to the following user journeys:
- User can upload a data file to the application. The data will be stored in the tool's database.
- User can view data that has been uploaded to the tool
- User can view relevant visualisation(s) of the data that has been uploaded

You do not have to use the scaffolding within this repository - it is optional, but
intended to remove some of the initial setup required. 

## Expectations
We do not expect a fully featured and polished web application at the end of this task.
The aim is to see how you approach problems, what elements you consider, and how you
evaluate your own work.
